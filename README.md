# Tic Tac Toe Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game that involves a nine-square grid. 

## Description
Each player alternately marks their space with an O or an X, and whichever player manages to mark three Os or Xs diagonally, horizontally, or vertically wins. Each player must also block their opponent while attempting to make their chain.

This program also uses the Python random module to select a random player to start the game. It also uses object-oriented programming to create a new class called TicTacToe.

Need to work on reverse diagonal win and the input of  values beyon the range 1 - 3... integer -1 overrides some answers in the mapping.

## Run Program
```bash
python3 main.py
```
